            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Many older people with asthma get sick when the air is very dirty, but they often do not notice because you cannot see pollution in the air.When the AQI (Air Quality Index) is high, the air has tiny harmful particles and gases that can get deep into the lungs. This can make asthma suddenly worse, causing coughing, wheezing, and trouble breathing, especially for grandparents and other elderly people.</p>

            <h2>What Climate Action Unit Does</h2>
            <p>Climate Action Unit is like a smart "air quality warning friend" for the whole world. It checks AQI in real time and shows clear, easy-to-read alerts so families know when the air is safe and when it is risky.Helping Elderly People with Asthmav.</p>

            <h2>Helping Elderly People with Asthma</h2>
            <p>Before taking an elderly person with asthma outside or to the airport, you can quickly check the AQI on Climate Action Unit. If the AQI is high, you can change the plan:
            
Stay indoors
Wear a mask
Use an air purifier
Keep inhalers ready to help prevent an asthma attack</p>

            <p>Air quality has become one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time. As urbanization accelerates and industrial activities expand, understanding global air quality trends is crucial for public health and environmental policy.</p>
            
            <h2>The Current State of Global Air Quality</h2>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization, 99% of the world's population breathes air that exceeds WHO guideline limits. This alarming statistic highlights the widespread nature of air pollution and its impact on human health.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Pollutants and Their Sources</h2>
            <p>The primary pollutants affecting air quality include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). These pollutants originate from various sources including vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and natural events.</p>
            
            <h2>Health Implications</h2>
            <p>Poor air quality is linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and reduced life expectancy. Children and elderly populations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution.</p>
            
            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>Addressing air quality requires coordinated efforts from governments, industries, and individuals. Monitoring systems like ours help raise awareness and enable informed decision-making.</p>

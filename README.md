# Climate Action Unit - Weather & AQI Checker

## Problem Statement

Many older people with asthma get sick when the air is very dirty, but they often do not notice because you cannot see pollution in the air.

When the AQI (Air Quality Index) is high, the air has tiny harmful particles and gases that can get deep into the lungs. This can make asthma suddenly worse, causing coughing, wheezing, and trouble breathing, especially for grandparents and other elderly people.

## What Climate Action Unit Does

Climate Action Unit is like a smart "air quality warning friend" for the whole world. It checks AQI in real time and shows clear, easy-to-read alerts so families know when the air is safe and when it is risky.

## Helping Elderly People with Asthma

Before taking an elderly person with asthma outside or to the airport, you can quickly check the AQI on Climate Action Unit. If the AQI is high, you can change the plan:
- Stay indoors
- Wear a mask
- Use an air purifier
- Keep inhalers ready to help prevent an asthma attack

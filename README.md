Problem Statement :Many older people with asthma get sick when the air is very dirty, but they often do not notice because you cannot see pollution in the air.
When the AQI (Air Quality Index) is high, the air has tiny harmful particles and gases that can get deep into the lungs. This can make asthma suddenly worse, causing coughing, wheezing, and trouble breathing, especially for grandparents and other elderly people.
What Weather Action Unit does
Weather Action Unit is like a smart “air quality warning friend” for the whole world. It checks AQI in real time and shows clear, easy to-read alerts so families know when the air is safe and when it is risky.
Helping elderly people with asthma
Before taking an elderly person with asthma outside or to the airport, you can quickly check the AQI on Weather Action Unit. If the AQI is high, you can change the plan: stay indoors, wear a mask, use an air purifier, and keep inhalers ready to help prevent an asthma attack.
